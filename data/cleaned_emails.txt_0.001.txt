here is our forecast traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip especially if you have to prepare a presentation i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary as far as the business meetings i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format my suggestion for where to go is austin play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski s flying somewhere takes too much time test

remaining approved multifamily parcels in westsan marcos which now has a moratorium on development several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher roughly  per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a  month lease and     psf if leased on a  month term but by individual room thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects just as the duplexes do now if this project is of serious interest to you please let me know as thereis a very very short window of opportunity the

description  gas physical financial positioni have scheduled and entered on each of your calendars a meeting for the above referenced topic it will take place on thursday   from     in room eb  closingjeff is the closing today after reviewing the agreement i find it isn t binding as far as i can determine it is too vague and it doesn t sound like anything an attorney or title company would draft for a real estate closing but of course i could be wrong if this closing is going to take place without this agreement then there is no point in me following up on this document s validity i will just need to go back to my closing documents and see what s there and find out where i am with that and deal with this as best i can i guess i was expecting something that would be an exhibit to a recordable document or something a little more exact or rather sort of a contract this isn t either i tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last night but he was out of pocket i talked to a crim atty friend and he said this is out of his area but doesn t sound binding to him i will go back to mine and phillip allen s transaction and take a look at that but as vague and general as this is i doubt that my signature is even needed to complete this transaction i am in after  noon if there is any need to contact me regarding the closing i really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself and i don t want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesn t seem to be something required for a closing in the event you do need my signature on something like this i

phillipjim is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing california this week can you make sure the gas desk is included phillipgeorge below is a list of questions that keith and i had regarding the westgate project ownership structure what will be the ownership structure limited partnership general partner what are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity regarding ownership and liabilities who owns the land improvements who holds the various loans is the land collateral investment what happens to initial investment is it used to purchase land for cash secure future loans why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement when is the   actually needed now or for the land closing investment schedule investment return is equity repayment the return of the original investment is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed debt which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan improvement construction are these the only two loans looks like it from the cash flow statement terms of each loan uses of funds how will disbursements be made by whom what type of bank account controls on max disbursement internet viewing for investors reports to track expenses vs plan bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses what is the relationship of creekside builders to the project do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits do you or larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits design and construction when will design be complete what input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units what level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting does creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors vendors and other professionals such as always getting  bids payment schedules or reference checking are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use names these questions are probably very basic to you but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me also i want to learn asmuch as possible from the process phillip  westgate proforma phillip allen xlsenclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austinthat we told you about as you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over  per year over  years this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asaustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the austin market the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan asit is in the smart growth corridor area designated by the city of austinfor preferred development this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than  months additionally many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived i have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a  lot development we investigated in northaustin which included a detention retention and filtration pond and streetwidening even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention retention and filtration pondrequirement i used this data to be cautious the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at st edwards university as with most infill projects the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven we have included a fence around the entire property but mayonly put it on westgate and cameron loop gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of   andan extended escrow this will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract which will mean that we can close intoan a d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan this analysis shows your investment at   for a  interest in theprofits of the project as we discussed in san marcos we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot i believe this would facilitate the use of a exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project you would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first larry lewter knows an expert in the field in sanantonio if you do not know anyone i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker by airborne express today for saturday delivery once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either   or    my cell phone is    and the fax is   i look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project

the site plans for the burnet deal remember we have to get brenda happy phillip     diffsocal     nwpl     san juan     the reason the benchmark report shows net selling san juan is that the transport positions were rolled in on   this added  shorts to san juan and  longs to socal before this adjustment we bought  san juan and sold  socal why is aeco basis so low on the list is nwpl mapped differently than aeco what about the correlation to nymex on aeco jeff you would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood i am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which i might become involved with creekside are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch i am not prepared to pay more than   for sagewood yet phillip sagewood town homesi was aware that regan lehman the lot developer for the entire  lotduplex project was selling his units in the  s he does have a muchlower basis in the lots than anyone else but the prime differences are dueto a he is selling them during construction and b they are smaller units we do not know the exact size of each of his units but we believe one ofthe duplexes is a   sq ft plan this would produce an average sqfootage of  which would be   psf at   i thought hissales price was   at this price psf our   sf unit would sellfor   what is more important in my view is a the rental rate and b therent ability you have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation as for rent ability i believe that we have shown that the bedroom   bath is strongly preferred in this market in fact if wewere able to purchase additional lots from regan we would

from him basically they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge

com theizen wsccnav  thoughts on presentationit is a shame that the caiso doesn t provide actual generation by unit the wscc data which is dicey and we don t have until july  and the cemms which comes on a delay are ultimately our best sources for your purposes the caiso may suffice i think that you probably know this already but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation you are pulling scheduled if someone doesn t schedule their generation and then generates either instructed or uninstructed then you will miss that you may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso that is if they have  mw of load and  mw of generation they may simply schedule  mw of load and sc transfers or imports of  mw having said all of that it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side on the load side i think that i would simply use caiso actual load while they don t split out np from sp i think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number the utilities play lots of game on the load side usually under scheduling depending on price i think the presentation looks good it would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished i d like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional gw of gas generated electricity especially compared to all gas consumption i was surprised by how small the ueg consumption was compared to other uses if it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a

grab lunch sometime phillip transport p lphillip i ve noticed one thing on your intra month transport p l that looks strange to me remember that i do not know the northwest at all so this may not be an issue but i ll point it out and let you decide let me know if this is o k as is so i ll know to ignore it in the future also if you want me to get with kim and the sitara people to change the mapping let me know and i ll take care of it on pg e nw it appears that pgen kingsgate is mapped to a malin citygate curve instead of a kingsgate curve resulting in a total transport loss of   if the mapping were changed it should just reallocate p l not change your overall p l maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that i am not seeing but anyway here are the deal s paths and p l impacts of each  from kingsgate to malin    from kingsgate to pgen tuscarora    from kingsgate to pgen malin    from kingsgate to malin    from kingsgate to stanfield   suggested fix change pgen kingsgate mapping from gdp malin citygate to gdp kingsgate clay basin storage this is really a fyi more than anything else i see five different tickets in sitara for clay basin activity one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections clay basin is valued as a questar curve which is substantially below nwpl points what this means is that any time you are injecting gas these tickets will show transport losses each time you are withdrawing you will show big gains on transport i m not sure of the best way to handle this since we don t really have a systematic sitara way of handling storage deals in an ideal world it seems that you would map it the way you have it today but during injection times the transport cost would pass through as storage costs anyway here s the detail on the tickets just for your info plus i noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from clay basin there may be an operational reason why this occurred that i m not aware of and the dollar impact is very small but i thought i d bring it to your attention just in case there s something you want to do about it the columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p l associated with each deal     p l          rec ques clay basin  nwpl opal  nwpl opal sumas nwpl s of gr rvrdel nwpl s of green river clay ques clay basin

questions xthank you phillip allen re this morning s commission meeting delayed phil i suspect that discussions negotiations are taking place behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms if not directly between commissioners then among ferc staffers never say never but i think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap i base this belief in large part on what i heard at a luncheon i attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was ferc chairman curt hebert although the chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the commission hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps price caps are almost never the right answerprice caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagescompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerany solution however short term that does not increase supply or reduce demand is not acceptableeight out of eleven western governors oppose price caps in that they would export california s problems to the westthis is the latest intelligence i have on the matter and it s a pretty strong anti price cap position of course hebert is just one commissioner out of  currently on the commission but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking the item could be bumped off the agenda hope

were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal however they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings we are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a non profit and costly function procurement and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product as to your other question we have yet to identify or pursue other candidates however mike mcdonald and i are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities we met with  entities this week  municipals and swg as we implement our strategy in california are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach otherwise we

supportsources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may th deadline any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart according to sources both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis the democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the long term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july   if not the state may be in breach of contract sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may th having a bond issuance by july st will be very difficult the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the  billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately  billion however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab x and ab x ab x authorizes the dwr to sell up to  billion in bonds this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support ab x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab x senator bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund for instance tony strickland has stated that only   of the bonds or approximately  billion should be issued other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan key points of the bridge financinginitial loan amount   blenders jp morgan   b lehman brothers   b bear stearns  mtax exempt portion of the   b   b is expected to be tax exemptprojected interest rate taxable rate   tax exempt rate   current projected blended ir   maturity date august  for more details please contact me at   bill sb x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this timethe senate passed sb x yesterday which authorizes  billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority the  billion authorized under sb x is not the same as the  billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward again the republicans are not in support of these authorizations without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the california public power and conservation authority however this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis socal edison and bankruptcyat this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august th however some decision will likely be made earlier according to sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has signed it the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb x bridge loan stating that the dwr would received  of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount in other words the state will get paid before the utilities if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments  re western wholesale activities gas power conf callprivileged confidential

suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary as far as the business meetings i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format my suggestion for where to go is austin play golf and rent a ski boat and jet

variable injection and withdrawal fees also an undiscounted june  to january  spread of   existed at the time of this bid bid for a  year storage contract beginning june  based on above assumptions   mmbtu month   year demand charges only i am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not please call or email with comments phillip allen re this morning s commission meeting delayed phil i suspect that discussions negotiations are taking place behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms if not directly between commissioners then among ferc staffers never say never but i think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap i base this belief in large part on what i heard at a luncheon i attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was ferc chairman curt hebert although the chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the commission hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps price caps are almost never the right answerprice caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagescompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerany solution however short term that does not increase supply or reduce demand is not acceptableeight out of eleven western governors oppose price caps in that they would export california s problems to the westthis is the latest intelligence i have on the matter and it s a pretty strong anti price cap position of course hebert is just one commissioner out of  currently on the commission but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking the item could be bumped off the agenda hope this info helps rayphillip k allen ect     pmto ray alvarez na enron enroncc

release what is the status on the quote from wade phillipi still use this service caiso demand reductionphillip et al i have been digging into the answer to your question re demand reduction in the west your intuition as to reductions seen so far e g march  vs march  was absolutely correct at this point it appears that demand over the last  months in the caiso control area after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors has fallen by about  this translates into a reduction of about     mwa for last month march  as compared with the previous year looking forward into the summer i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts other forecasters e g pira are estimating that another     mwa making total year on year reduction     will come off starting in june this scenario is not difficult to imagine as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand given that the  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market and that rates are now scheduled to increase i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as  relative to last year this would mean peak demand reductions of approx     mwa in jun aug in addition a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the state which can only increase the likelihood of meeting and perhaps exceeding the   mwa figure finally the general economic slowdown in calif could also further depress demand or at least make the   mwa number that much more attainable note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only which represents about  of total calif load or   of wscc u s summer load i think it is reasonable to assume that the non iso portion of calif i e ladwp and iid will see similar reductions in demand as for the rest of the wscc that is a much more difficult call as you are aware the pacific nw has already seen about   mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep and possibly for the next couple of years if bpa gets its wish this figure represents approx  of the non calif wscc several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production i have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many mw this translates to but i will continue to research the issue other large industrials may follow suit and the ripple effects from calif s economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the west while the rest of the wscc may not see the  reductions that i am expecting in calif i think we could easily expect an additional   on top of the  already realized or approx     mwa of further demand reduction in the non calif wscc for this summer this would bring the total reduction for the wscc including the   mwa aluminum load we have already seen to around     mwa when compared with last summer i am continuing to research and monitor the situation and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available meantime i hope this helps please feel

rotation unnecessary unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk phillip no problemreagan thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence below is a list of questions on the specs  is the framing lumber  yellow pine wouldn t fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same  what type of floor joist would be used x or some sort of factory joist  what type for roof framing on site built rafters or engineered trusses  are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound what type of insulation in floors and ceiling batts or blown fiberglass or cellulose  any ridge venting or other vents power or turbine  did you bid for interior windows to have trim on  sides i didn t know the difference between an apron and a stool  do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking double plywood or hardi board underlay  on the stairs did you allow for a bannister i was thinking a partial one out of iron only about  feet  i did not label it on the plan but i was intending for a   bath under the stairs a pedestal sink would probably work  are undermount sinks different than drop ins i was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths   or  a c units i am assuming   prewired for sound indoors and outdoors  no door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets  exterior porches included in bid cedar decking on upstairs iron railings  what type of construction contract would you use fixed price except for change orders i want to get painfully detailed with the specs before i make a decision but this is a start i think i am ready to get plans drawn up i am going to call cary kipp tosee about setting up a design meeting to see if i like his ideas phillipi larry jacques has sent a document to claudia for your review just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it phillipjacques would it be ok if i signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect they have both sent me agreements the only paymentthat george and larry had made was   to the architect i have written personal checks in the amounts of   to the architect and   to the engineer i was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership i would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me should i wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership let me know what you think phillip  greg here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates cost per square foot seem too low for construction   sf gross  sf rentable what do the cost for on site general requirements   represent will you review the builders profit and fees with me again you mentioned  overhead  and  profit why is profit only  why are the architect fees up to k i thought they would be k what is the k of profit allowance is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost total closing and application costs of k that seems very high who receives the  points how much will be sunk costs if fha declines us where is your  are you receiving one of the points on the loan what is the status on the operating pro forma my back of the envelope puts noi at k assuming  br  br  br  vacancy and  expenses after debt service that would only leave k the coverage would only be   talk to you this

please send wiring instructions greg something that i forgot to ask you do you know if hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which i understand is quicker than the full replatting process of  weeks also let me know about the parking the builder in san marcos believed the plan only had  parking spots but would require  by code the townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem they probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms phillipkeith holst sent you an email with the details jacques the agreement looks fine my only comment is that george and larry might object to the language that the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the project technically that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required did i loan them    i thought it was less regarding exhibit a the assets include the land architectural plans engineering completed appraisal and soils study most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants i have been speaking directly to the architect engineer and soils engineer i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of   for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor

doing so inorder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff the agency said it hadbeen telling california s department of water resources that thesales could cease at any time and this morning they ended

larry it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials then there is a layer of construction management fees of  there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money but i think the majority of it is profit finally the builders profit of   million keith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit after all if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors we were definitely not intending to insert an additional  fee in addition to the superintendent costs george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don t think the construction management fee is included george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard i will review and let you know what i think the gp issues don t seem to be a point of contention they are agreeable to the  out  approval process let me know if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for only true costs   million phillipgeorge please send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning phillipjeanie

the cal border basis obviously it is dependent on what capacity is added on kern pgt and tw but it is hard to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand even if it is subscribed it will take

but the rentroll only adds up to  the missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below   did he pay the rent he missed on     did he miss rent on   and     missed on     missed on     missed on     missed on   and has not paid the  from    a missed on     missed on   my guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the   rentroll you may have sent me a

be valued on an  or  cap jacques can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract the key business points are  investment is a loan with prime  rate construction contract is cost plus   million the investors loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid  all parties are gp s but  out  votes needed for major decisions    split favoring the investors with regard to the construction contract we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses keith and i would like to oversee the bookkeeping the builders would be requred to fax all invoices within  hours we also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted let me know if you can draft these agreements the gp issue may need some tweaking phillip allen  pallen enron comlucy here is a final

therefore i could take a sales price of k and carry a second note of k this would still only require k cash from the buyer after broker fees and a title policy i would net around k cash you can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at  or higher with the terms described in the st email do you want to give the new braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal phillipjeff i am not willing to guarantee to refinance the st lien on the stage in  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to  there are several reasons that i won t commit to this exposure to interest fluctuations the large cash reserves needed and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns what i am willing to do is lower the second note to  amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to  years the existing note does not come due until september  that is a long time the buyer may have sold the property interest rates may be lower i am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far can you clarify the dates in the contract is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete hopefully the buyer can live with these terms i got your fax from the new braunfels buyer if we can t come to terms with the first buyer i will get started on the list email or call me later today phillipsusan raised your issue to sally beck larry is going to spend time with you to see if he can live without any reports also some

that are not on the lease when the manager has a houseful of guests i realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager but you need to put in  hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property i am not upset that you asked for a raise but the answer is no at this time we can

unfortunately i did not hear from them this week the are promising to have some feedback by monday i will let you know as soon as i hear from them phillipgeorge the probability of building a house this year is increasing i have shifted to a slightly different plan there were too many design items that i could not work out in the plan we discussed previously now i am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center one wing would have a living dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with  kid bedrooms a laundry room upstairs the other wing would have a garage guestroom downstairs with a game room office exercise room upstairs this plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living i am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west the center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts i am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building i don t know if you can imagine the house i am trying to describe i would like to come and visit you again this month if it would work for you i would like to drive up on sunday afternoon on feb  around  or  pm i would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn t have time for i can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan call or email to let me know if this would work for you pallen hotmail com or    home    work phillip allenps channel  in houston ran a story yesterday feb  about a home in kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls you should try their website or call the station to get the full story it would makes a good case for breathable walls  that s twice as valuable as your car can t you get a used one for  nice how much are you trying to keep the economy going  testingjeff before you write off the stage a few things to think about  operating expenses include   of materials for maintenance and repairs plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs there are only  units a lot of his time is spent on repairs  what is an outside management firm going to do a full time onsite manager is all that is required as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite  considering     noi is not necessarily overstated if you want to be ultra conservative use   at the lowest  getting cash out is not a priority to me so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash a  note actually attractive see below my job just doesn t give me the time to manage this property this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort sales price  st lien  nd lien  transfer fee  cash required  noi  st lien  nd lien  cash flow  cash on cash  these numbers are using the conservative noi if it comes in at k then cash on cash return would be more like  this doesn t reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price do you want to reconsider let me know phillip

smith street eb houston texas phone   fax    forwarded by travis mccullough hou ect on      pm william s bradford      pm to travis mccullough hou ect ect cc by steve everly the kansas city stardate     as natural gas prices rose in december traders at the new york mercantile exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas and the forecast was for frigid weather traders put the two together anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights traders do that all the time they re looking forward said william burson a trader it makes the market for natural gas but the market s response perplexed chris mcgill the american gas association s director of gas supply and transportation he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in  and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality it s a little frustrating that they don t take the time to understand what we are reporting mcgill said as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills the hunt for reasons and culprits is on some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street stephen adik senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market s speculators for the rise in gas prices it s my firm belief that today s gas prices are being manipulated adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly in california where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis six investigations are looking into the power industry closer to home observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter s startling gas bills having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes most utilities often with the acquiescence of regulators failed to take precautions such as fixed rate contracts and hedging a sort of price insurance that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared we re passing on our gas costs which we have no control over said paul snider a spokesman for missouri gas energy but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers there s been a failure of risk management by utilities and that needs to change said ed krapels director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc an energy consulting firm in wakefield mass hot topic consumers know one thing for certain their heating bills are up sharply in many circles little else is discussed the rev vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is facing a   december bill for heating the church more than double the previous december s bill church members are suffering from higher bills as well the sunday collection is down said fraser who might have to forgo part of his salary for the first time the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating it s the talk of the town here he said a year ago that wasn t a fear wholesale gas prices hovered just above  per thousand cubic feet a level that producers say didn t make it worthwhile to drill for gas utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers but trouble was brewing by spring gas prices were hitting  per thousand cubic feet just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter there was a dip in the fall but then prices rebounded by early november prices were at  per thousand cubic feet the federal energy information administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be  percent to  percent higher but  gas was coming below normal temperatures hit much of the country including the kansas city area and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets it s all about the weather said krapels of energy security analysis wholesale prices exploded to  per thousand cubic feet led by the new york traders natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price volatile commodity in the world setting the price in the s the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas allowing it to float in  the new york mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce and big gas consumers from utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas and often with little real knowledge of natural gas but if they get on the right side of a price trend traders don t need to know much about gas or whatever commodity they re trading like all futures the gas contracts are purchased on credit that leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time as december began the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than  per thousand cubic feet by the end of the month it was nearly  much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association s weekly storage numbers utilities buy ahead and store as much as  percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter going into the winter the storage levels were about  percent less than average in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing in hopes that the summer s unusually high  to  prices would drop still the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient but when below normal temperatures arrived in november the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient then the american gas association reported the lowest year end storage numbers since they were first published in  still said the association s mcgill there was sufficient gas in storage but some utility executives didn t share that view william eliason vice president of kansas gas service said that if december s cold snap had continued into january there could have been a real problem meeting demand i was getting worried he said then suddenly the market turned when january s weather turned warmer wednesday s storage numbers were better than expected and futures prices dropped more than  per thousand cubic feet just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers among area utilities kansas gas service increased its customers cost of gas charge earlier this month to   per thousand cubic feet and missouri gas energy has requested an increase to   to begin wednesday sheila lumpe chairwoman of the missouri public service commission said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level payment plan and to conserve energy kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place which is expected to save an average customer about  this winter missouri gas energy has no hedging program it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs on friday doug micheel senior counsel of the missouri office of the public counsel said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy s gas purchasing practices consumers are taking all the risk micheel said it s time to consider some changes to reach steve everly call    or send e mail to severly kcstar com all content  the kansas city

director kari dohn and myself the gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governor s ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor s comments overview we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees his staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers including utility owned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost plus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at mw he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by  and provide some political cover our proposals i have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided he seemed interested in  the buy down of significant demand  the state setting a goal of x mw of new generation by a date certain  getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and  setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases as already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities his ideas the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming some of these ideas would require legislative action state may build or make build transfer arrangements a couple of generation plants the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases this was a frequently recurring theme utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost plus basis to consumers municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california state universities including uc csu and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation expand in state gas production take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies empower an existing state agency to approve coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool works jeff someone in schroeder s group should be able to help out here wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators securitize uncollected power purchase costs to dos jeff again i d like to prevail on you to assemble the group s thoughts and get them to kari he wants to see  year fixed power prices for peak off peak and baseload not just the  one year strips he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues thanks to everyone for

investors to personally guarantee if there is a creative way to structure the deal i would like to hear your suggestions one idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a forward commitment in order to reduce the equity required i would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed specifically the transition from interim to permanent financing i could use a quick

so i just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can phillipsteve i am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail if you need to call with questions my home number is    as far as recommendations here is a short list  examine ldc s incentive rate program current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost the result is that the ldc s sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index this creates a shortage in later months  california has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand investigate why it wasn t maximized operationally specific questions should include  why in march  may  weren t total system receipts higher in order to fill storage  why are there so many examples of ofo s on weekends that push away too much gas from socal s system i believe socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand they repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity but injected far less  similar to the power market there is too much benchmarking to short term prices not enough forward hedging is done by the major ldcs by design the customers are short at a floating rate this market has been long historically it has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted

ourstandard rate of  this will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof  this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity also we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high therefore we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids as the met project next door is reported to have cost  psfwithout overhead or cmf which is   with cmf it appears that the cash equity will be    however i am fairlysure that we can get this project done with  mm i hope to finish the proforma today the rental rates that we project are  for the  ada

not meet their may th deadline due to lack of supportsources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may th deadline any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart according to sources both the republic ans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis the democratic cauc us is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis many legislative republic ans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that o nce the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg islature and the governor however it is believed once davis discloses th e details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take plac e additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the lon g term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require t hat the bond issuance happen by july   if not the state may be in breach of contract sources state that if the legislature does not pass th e bridge loan legislation by may th having a bond issuance by july st wi ll be very difficult the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat e would eat the  billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately  billion however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for ful l disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab x and ab x ab x authorizes the dwr to sell up to  billion in bonds this bi ll passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lac k of republican support ab x deals with energy conservation programs fo r community college districts however sources report this bill may be am ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen curre ntly in ab x senator bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be li kely to cause a socal bankruptcy  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republic ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund for instance tony strickland has stated that only   of the bonds or approximately  billion should be issued other republ icans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday additionally lehman brothers repo rtedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind ications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan key points of the bridge financinginitial loan amount    blenders  jp morgan     b   lehman brothers     b   bear stearns    mtax exempt portion of the   b   b is expected to be tax exemptprojected interest rate taxable rate      tax exempt rate    current projected blended ir    maturity date  august  for more details please contact me at   bill sb x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this timethe senate passed sb x yesterday which authorizes  billion to create t he california consumer power and conservation authority the  billion authorized under sb x is not the same as the  billion that must be aut horized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the addi tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward again the republicans are not in support of these authoriz ations without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support no f urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchas ing power also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the calif ornia public power and conservation authority however this can be consi dered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earl ier in the crisis socal edison and bankruptcyat this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy t he first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is au gust th however some decision will likely be made earlier according t o sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has s igned it the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davi s and the senate lack the votes needed to pass if the legislature indicat es that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bank ruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond is suance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb x bridge loan s tating that the dwr would received  of its payments from ratepayers th en the utilities would receive the residual amount in other words the st ate will get paid before the utilities if this language is included and p assed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments  generationhttp westpower enron com ca generation default aspbob activate plan b no money from john wish i had better news phillipdave the back office is having a

tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time she frequently came to work before  am to prepare operations reports patti worked  days a week during this time if long hours were not enough there was a pipeline explosion during this time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on patti she didn t crack and provided much needed info during this time patti is

construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership each of the individual investors andall of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee theloans if the investor s do not sign on the loans this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profitsis reduced all loans for residential construction that are intended for re sale

plusapproximately   of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees equity at improvement loanonce the site plan is approved by the city of austin the city will requirethe development entity to

have been completed and accepted by coa this release will befor  of the cost with the remaining  released one year aftercompletion releases can be granted once every  days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur  months after the start of lotimprovement construction these fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit as such they have to be counted as adevelopment cost even though they are not spent because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds the lot improvement loan is typically  of the appraised value of afinished lot which i suspect will be at least   and potentially ashigh as   this would produce a loan amount of   on  per lot with estimated per lot improvement costs of   fiscals at   and the land cost at   total improved lot cost is  which means  to   per lot in total equity the investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs thus the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be    even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side the engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement phasing works as follows if the first phase was say  units the totallot improvement cost might average   per lot of this probably   would be for improvements and   for the land cost theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts the entry road water treatment costs perimeter fencing andlandscaping and so on as well as for  of the land the land loan forundeveloped lots would be  of the appraised raw lot value which i wouldestimate as   per lot for a loan value of   per lot then theloan value for each improved lot would be   per lot this would giveyou a total loan of   total cost of    for equity requiredof   this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint construction loansthere are three types of construction loans first is a speculative spec loan that is taken out prior to any pre sales activity second isa construction loan for a pre sold unit but the loan remains in thebuilder developers name third is a pre sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer we expect to have up to  spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre sold units with loansin the name of the builder developer we do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process spec loans will be for  to  of value and construction loans forpre sold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender willbe from  to  of value disbursementsdisbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current andnear term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement the general partnerwill contract with creekside builders llc to construct the units and thefee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs these fees are the only monies to creekside larry lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit except for a direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform for example if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub orcannot find enough trim carpenters etc and it decides to undertake thisfunction it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose

or something a little more exact or rather sort of a contract this isn t either i tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last night but he was out of pocket i talked to a crim atty friend and he said this is out of his area but doesn t sound binding to him i will go back to mine and phillip allen s transaction and take a look at that but as vague and general as this is i doubt that my signature is even needed to complete this transaction i am in after  noon if there is any need to contact me regarding the closing i really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself and i don t want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesn t seem to be something required for a closing in the event you do need my signature on something like this i would rather have time to have it reviewed before i accept it brenda chris what is the latest with pg e we have been having good discussions regarding eol call me when you can xphillip forwarded by phillip k allen

by their trailblazer transport they are unhedged   d in  and   d in  and  they are scrubbing all their books and booking the hubert deal on wednesday and thursday phillipgeorge below is a list of questions that keith and i had regarding the westgate project ownership structure what will be the ownership structure limited partnership general partner what are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity regarding ownership and liabilities who owns the land improvements who holds the various loans is the land collateral investment what happens to initial investment is it used to purchase land for cash secure future loans why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement when is the   actually needed now or for the land closing investment schedule investment return is equity repayment the return of the original investment is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed debt which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan improvement construction are these the only two loans looks like it from the cash flow statement terms of each loan uses of funds how will disbursements be made by whom what type of bank account controls on max disbursement internet viewing for investors reports to track expenses vs plan bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses what is the relationship of creekside builders to the project do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits do you or larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits design and construction when will design be complete what input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units what level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting does creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors vendors and other professionals such as always getting  bids payment schedules or reference checking are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use names these questions are probably very basic to you but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me also i want to learn asmuch as possible from the process phillip  westgate proforma phillip allen xlsenclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austinthat we told you about as you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over  per year over  years this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asaustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the austin market the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan asit is in the smart growth corridor area designated by the city of austinfor preferred development this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than  months additionally many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived i have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a  lot development we investigated in northaustin which included a detention retention and filtration pond and streetwidening even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention retention and filtration pondrequirement i used this data to be cautious the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline such as theadjoining single family

nwpl     san juan     the reason the benchmark report shows net selling san juan is that the transport positions were rolled in on   this added  shorts to san juan and  longs to socal before this adjustment we bought  san juan and sold  socal why is aeco basis so low on the list is nwpl mapped differently than aeco what about the correlation to nymex on aeco jeff you would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood i am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which i might become involved with creekside are you in the business of brokering properties

during construction and b they are smaller units we do not know the exact size of each of his units but we believe one ofthe duplexes is a   sq ft plan this would produce an average sqfootage of

denver book thanks in advance mick walters ebdscott i emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company i think i know the answer to your questions but i want to get the exact details from him basically they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk this is my best guess i will get back to you with more philliplucy i want to speak to wade myself he can call me at work or home or if you email me his number i will call him i would like gary to direct wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance i will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office do you need mary to come in on any more fridays i think i can guess your answer i might stop by this friday philliphttp ectpdx sunone ect enron com theizen wsccnav  thoughts on presentationit is a shame that the caiso doesn t provide actual generation by unit the wscc data which is dicey and we don t have until july  and the cemms which comes on a delay are ultimately our best sources for your purposes the caiso may suffice i think that you probably know this already but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation you are pulling scheduled if someone doesn t schedule their generation and then generates either instructed or uninstructed then you will miss that you may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso that is if they have  mw of load and  mw of generation they may simply schedule  mw of load and sc transfers or imports of  mw having said all of that it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side on the load side i think that i would simply use caiso actual load while they don t split out np from sp i think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number the utilities play lots of game on the load side usually under scheduling depending on price i think the presentation looks good it would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished i d like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional gw of gas generated electricity especially compared to all gas consumption i was surprised by how small the ueg consumption was compared to other uses if it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a

at all so this may not be an issue but i ll point it out and let you decide let me know if this is o k as is so i ll know to ignore it in the future also if you want me to get with kim and the sitara people to change the mapping let me know and i ll take care of it on pg e nw it appears that pgen kingsgate is mapped to a malin citygate curve instead of a kingsgate curve resulting in a total transport loss of   if the mapping were changed it should just reallocate p l not change your overall p l maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that i am not seeing but anyway here are the deal s paths and p l impacts of each  from kingsgate to malin    from kingsgate to pgen tuscarora    from kingsgate to pgen malin    from kingsgate to malin    from kingsgate to stanfield   suggested fix change pgen kingsgate mapping from gdp malin citygate to gdp kingsgate clay basin storage this is really a fyi more than anything else i see five different tickets in sitara for clay basin activity one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections clay basin is valued as a questar curve which is substantially below nwpl points what this means is that any time you are injecting gas these tickets will show transport losses each time you are withdrawing you will show big gains on transport i m not sure of the best way to handle this since we don t really have a systematic sitara way of handling storage deals in an ideal world it seems that you would map it the way you have it today but during injection times the transport cost would pass through as storage costs anyway here s the detail on the tickets just for your info plus i noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from clay basin there may be an operational reason why this occurred that i m not aware of and the dollar impact is very small but i thought i d bring it to your attention just in case there s something you want to do about it the columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p l associated with each deal     p l          rec ques clay basin  nwpl opal  nwpl opal sumas nwpl s of gr rvrdel nwpl s of green

sw gas this morning they were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal however they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings we are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a non profit and costly function procurement and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product as to your other question we have yet to identify or pursue other candidates however mike mcdonald and i are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities we met with  entities this week  municipals and swg as we implement our strategy in california are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach otherwise we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates laird sw gas forwarded by jane m tholt hou ect on      am laird dyer     amto jane m tholt hou ect

finishing here s what we found oringinal plan was for stamped and pigmented color added at the cementplant with stained accents and highlighting to simulate a sautillo tile ourproject is rather large  sq ft sb house with  sq ft porch surrounding it lot s of cement approx  sq yds after looking at the costs we changed ourminds rather quickly labor for stamping crew   davis color stain lbs per yd x  yds x  lb   these are above and beyond the cost of the concrete actual result took a truck and trailer to mexico and handpicked sautillotiles for inside the house changed the color of the cement on the porch to lbper yd mix color added the overrun tiles we had left over as stringers in theporch and accented with acid etched stain tiles and transportation   labor mastic and beer tile setting did it myself   acid stain for porch   davis pigment  x  yds   i can get you the info on the stain if you like i ordered it from acompany the web can t remember off hand who i ordered a sample kit for   whichhas  colors you can mix and match for the results you want it was easy to workwith much like painting in water colors on a large scale hope this helps you out matt kizziah paasender owner

financing bills may not meet their may th deadline due to lack of supportsources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may th deadline any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart according to sources both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis the democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the long term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july   if not the state may be in breach of contract sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may th having a bond issuance by july st will be very difficult the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the  billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately  billion however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab x and ab x ab x authorizes the dwr to sell up to  billion in bonds this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support ab x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab x senator bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund for instance tony strickland has stated that only   of the bonds or approximately  billion should be issued other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan key points of the bridge financinginitial loan amount   blenders jp morgan   b lehman brothers   b bear stearns  mtax exempt portion of the   b   b is expected to be tax exemptprojected interest rate taxable rate   tax exempt rate   current projected blended ir   maturity date august  for more details please contact me at   bill sb x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this timethe senate passed sb x yesterday which authorizes  billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority the  billion authorized under sb x is not the same as the  billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward again the republicans are not in support of these authorizations without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the california public power and conservation authority however this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis socal edison and bankruptcyat this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august th however some decision will likely be made earlier according to sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has signed it the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb x bridge loan stating that the dwr would received  of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount in other words the state will get paid before the utilities if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments transwestern pipeline co posted new notice s since our last check at       pm the newest notice looks like capacity constraint dec    pm dec    am dec    am  allocation socal needlesplease

presentation i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary as far as the business meetings i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format my suggestion for where to go is austin play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski s flying somewhere takes too much time tim mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site can you please make sure he has an active password thank you

west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer winter spreads and cycling value the following assumptions were made to establish our bid  daily injection capacity  daily withdrawal capacity  fuel injection only   mmbtu variable injection and withdrawal fees also an undiscounted june  to january  spread of   existed at the time of this bid bid for a  year storage contract beginning june  based on above assumptions   mmbtu month   year demand charges only i am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not please call or email with comments phillip allen re this morning s commission meeting delayed phil i suspect that discussions negotiations are taking place behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms if not directly between commissioners then among ferc staffers never say never but i think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap i base this belief in large part on what i heard at a luncheon i attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was ferc chairman curt hebert although the chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the commission hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps price caps are almost never the right answerprice caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagescompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerany solution however short term that does not increase supply or reduce demand is not acceptableeight out of eleven western governors oppose price caps in that they would export california s problems to the westthis is the latest intelligence i have on the matter and it s a pretty strong anti price cap position of course hebert is just one commissioner out of  currently on the commission but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking the item could be bumped off the agenda hope this info helps rayphillip k allen ect     pmto ray alvarez na enron enroncc are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting is there the potential for a surprise

contractor i realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale i just want to assure you that i am going to build this house in

floor plan i am going to have an architect in austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed specification list i will send you that detailed plan and spec list when complete for a final bid probably in early to mid june phillip caiso demand reductionphillip et al i have been digging into the answer to your question re demand reduction in the west your intuition as to reductions seen so far e g march  vs march  was absolutely correct at this point it appears that demand over the last  months in the caiso control area after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors has fallen by about  this translates into a reduction of about     mwa for last month march  as compared with the previous year looking forward into the summer i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts other forecasters e g pira are estimating that another     mwa making total year on year reduction     will come off starting in june this scenario is not difficult to imagine as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand given that the  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market and that rates are now scheduled to increase i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as  relative to last year this would mean peak demand reductions of approx     mwa in jun aug in addition a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the state which can only increase the likelihood of meeting and perhaps exceeding the   mwa figure finally the general economic slowdown in calif could also further depress demand or at least make the   mwa number that much more attainable note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only which represents about  of total calif load or   of wscc u s summer load i think it is reasonable to assume that the non iso portion of calif i e ladwp and iid will see similar reductions in demand as for the rest of the wscc that is a much more difficult call as you are aware the pacific nw has already seen about   mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep and possibly for the next couple of years if bpa gets its wish this figure represents approx  of the non calif wscc several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production i have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many mw this translates to but i will continue to research the issue other large industrials may follow suit and the ripple effects from calif s economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the west while the rest of the wscc may not see the  reductions that i am expecting in calif i think we could easily expect an additional   on top of the  already realized or approx     mwa of further demand reduction in the non calif wscc for this summer this would bring the total reduction for the wscc including the   mwa aluminum load we have already seen to around     mwa when compared with last summer i am continuing to research and monitor the situation and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available meantime i hope this helps please feel free to call    if you have any questions or need any further information lucy here is the rentroll from last friday the closing was to be this thursday but it has been delayed until friday april th if you can stay on until april th that would

closing has been postponed as i mentioned i am going to have cary kipp draw the plans for the residence and i will get back in touch with you once he is finished regarding the multifamily project i am going to work with a project manager from san antonio for my first development project i feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining fha financing we are working with kipp flores to finalize

strong local relationships i will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan phillip allenjacques the amounts needed to fill in the blanks on exhibit b are as follows kipp flores total contract was   but   was paid and only   is outstanding kohutek   cuatro  george larry paid   for the appraisal and i agreed to reimburse this amount the

anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed phillipjohn regarding the employment agreement mike declined without a counter keith said he would sign for k cash  equity i still believe frank should receive the same signing incentives as keith phillipthanks for the response i think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step i had already contacted cary kipp and sent him the floor plan he got back to me yesterday with his first draft he took my plan and improved it i am going to officially engage cary to draw the plans while he works on those i

partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership let me know what you think phillip  greg here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates cost per square foot seem too low for construction   sf gross  sf rentable what do the cost for on site general requirements   represent will you review the builders profit and fees with me again you mentioned  overhead  and  profit why is profit only  why are the architect fees up to k i thought they would be k what is the k of profit allowance is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost total closing

know about the parking the builder in san marcos believed the plan only had  parking spots but would require  by code the townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem they probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms phillipkeith holst sent you an email with the details jacques the agreement looks fine my only comment is that george and larry might object to the language that the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the project technically that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required did i loan them    i thought it was less regarding exhibit a the assets include the land architectural plans engineering completed appraisal and soils study most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants i have been speaking directly to the architect engineer and soils engineer i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of   for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor phillip dj cal iso pays m to avoid rolling

hadbeen telling california s department of water resources that thesales could cease at any time and this morning they ended cal iso reported about   mw less imports today thanyesterday so it appears other sellers have also cut back yesterday powerex said it was not selling into california becauseof concerns about its water reserves bpa said it is still sendingexchange energy into california

includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials then there is a layer of construction management fees of  there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money but i think the majority of it is profit finally the builders profit of   million keith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit after all if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors we were definitely not intending to insert an additional  fee in addition to the superintendent costs george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don t think the construction management fee is included george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard i will review and let you know what i think the gp issues don t seem to be a point of contention they are agreeable to the  out  approval process let me know if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for only true

the structure they are looking for is a firm physical sale at a nymex related price there is a very good chance that they will do this all with one party we are definitely being considered as that party given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into kern river what would be your bid for this gas forwarded by

can really build this many plants it could have a huge impact on the cal border basis obviously it is dependent on what capacity is added on kern pgt and tw but it is hard to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand even if it is subscribed it will take  months to  years to build new pipe therefore the el paso   bcf d could be even more valuable mark forwarded by mark whitt na

investment is a loan with prime  rate construction contract is cost plus   million the investors loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid  all parties are gp s but  out  votes needed for major decisions    split favoring the investors with regard to the construction contract we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses keith and i would like to oversee the bookkeeping the builders would be requred to fax all invoices within  hours we also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted let me know if you can draft these agreements the gp issue may need some

there are too many to list individuallyjeff my target is to get  back out of the stage therefore i could take a sales price of k and carry a second note of k this would still only require k cash from the buyer after broker fees and a title policy i would net around k cash you can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at  or higher with the terms described in the st email do you want to give the new braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal phillipjeff i am not willing to guarantee to refinance the st lien on the stage in  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to  there are several reasons that i won t commit to this exposure to interest fluctuations the large cash reserves needed and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns what i am willing to do is lower the second note to  amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to  years the existing note does not come due until september  that is a long time the buyer may have sold the property interest rates may be lower i am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far can you clarify the dates in the contract is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete hopefully the buyer can live with these terms i got your fax from the new braunfels buyer if we can t come to terms with the first buyer i will get started on the list email or call me later today phillipsusan raised your issue to sally beck larry is going to spend time

hear from them phillipgeorge the probability of building a house this year is increasing i have shifted to a slightly different plan there were too many design items that i could not work out in the plan we discussed previously now i am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center one wing would have a living dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with  kid bedrooms a laundry room upstairs the other wing would have a garage guestroom downstairs with a game room office exercise room upstairs this plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living i am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west the center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts i am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building i don t know if you can imagine the house i am trying to describe i would like to come and visit you again this month if it would work for you i would like to drive up on sunday afternoon on feb  around  or  pm i would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn t have time for i can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan call or email to let me know if this would work for you pallen hotmail com or    home    work phillip allenps channel  in houston ran a story yesterday feb  about a home in kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls you should try their website or call the station to get the full story it would makes a good case for breathable walls  that s twice as valuable as your car can t you get a used one for  nice how much are you trying to keep the economy going  testingjeff before you write off the stage a few things to think about  operating expenses include   of materials for maintenance and repairs plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs there are only  units a lot of his time is spent on repairs  what is an outside management firm going to do a full time onsite manager is all that is required as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite  considering     noi is not necessarily overstated if you want to be ultra conservative use   at the lowest  getting cash out is not a priority to me so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash a  note actually attractive see below my job just doesn t give me the time to manage this property this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort sales price  st lien  nd lien  transfer fee  cash required  noi  st lien  nd lien  cash flow  cash on cash  these numbers are using the conservative noi if it comes in at k then cash on cash return would be more like  this doesn t reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price do you want to reconsider let me know phillip highlights of executive summary by kpmg cpuc audit report on edison forwarded by susan j mara na enron on      am  daniel

in the stagecoach it looks like i need to get around k to breakeven i don t need the cash out right now so if i could get a personal guarantee and jaques craig can work out the partnership transfer i would definitely be willing to carry a second lien i understand second liens are going for   checkout this spreadsheet these numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes however i am very concerned about the way it is being shown having lucy show it is not a good idea i need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property my dad doesn t have the time and i don t trust lucy or wade to show it correctly i would prefer for you to show it from now on i will have the operating statements complete through december by this friday phillip re sm george here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit check my math but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation at permanent financing   would be paid leaving only  to pay out in the st year since almost  of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment i feel the   is a fair split however as i mentioned earlier i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas  fixed construction profit of   million builder doesn t benefit from higher cost rather suffers as an equity holder   equity for meeting time and costs in original plan  sq ft phase  complete in november  equity for under budget and ahead of schedule  equity for over budget and behind schedulethis way if things go according to plan the final split would be   but could be as favorable as   i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon feel free to call me at home   phillip george we should hear from the bank in houston on monday the best

new york mercantile exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas and the forecast was for frigid weather traders put the two together anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights traders do that all the time they re looking forward said william burson a trader it makes the market for natural gas but the market s response perplexed chris mcgill the american gas association s director of gas supply and transportation he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in  and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality it s a little frustrating that they don t take the time to understand what we are reporting mcgill said as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills the hunt for reasons and culprits is on some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street stephen adik senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market s speculators for the rise in gas prices it s my firm belief that today s gas prices are being manipulated adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly in california where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis six investigations are looking into the power industry closer to home observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter s startling gas bills having failed to protect their
